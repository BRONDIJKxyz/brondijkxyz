# Instructions for Windsurf

## Project Setup
1. **Initialize project environment:**  
   
   - Set up any required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` or `package.json` file.

2. **Directory structure requirements:**  
   - All documentation must be in Markdown format (`.md`).  
   - Each project directory should contain a `README.md` file that outlines:  
     - Project purpose  
     - How to run or view the project  
     - License information (if applicable)  
   - Use a consistent naming convention for all project directories and files.

## Development Guidelines
1. **Minimal resource usage:**  
   - Ensure that processes run efficiently to minimize Windsurf action credits.  
   - Avoid redundant builds by caching dependencies and using build tools that support incremental updates.  
   - Terminate local development servers after use.

2. **Testing and compatibility:**  
   - Always run tests with Python 3 (or the latest stable version of your chosen language/framework).  
   - Check that the site functions correctly in modern web browsers, including mobile browsers.  
   - Document any known issues or workarounds in the `README.md` for each project.

## Deployment Workflow
1. **Build and deploy:**  
   - Generate the final static files or bundled code.  
   - Deploy the site to the hosting environment defined in the project settings.

2. **Post-deployment steps:**  
   - Verify that all links are working and that the site is accessible from both desktop and mobile devices.  
   - Ensure that visitors redirected from Twitter land on the homepage or a specific introduction page.  
   - If possible, set up simple analytics (without overloading the site) to track which projects visitors are viewing most often.
