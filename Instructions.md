# Instructions for Windsurf

## Project Objective
Brondijk.xyz is a minimalist, code-centric site showcasing Maarten Brondijk’s technical projects. The focus is on a stripped-back, dark-themed layout that highlights the projects themselves, without personal content or unnecessary design elements.

## Design and Structure
1. **One-Page Layout:**  
   - The site should be a single, lightweight page listing all projects.  
   - Each project entry includes:  
     - A title.  
     - A brief one-line description.  
     - A single link (either to the live site or the repository).

2. **Minimal Navigation:**  
   - Include a small, fixed menu at the top or side with these options:  
     - “Home”  
     - “Projects”  
     - “GitHub”  
   - The navigation should stay out of the way and serve purely functional purposes.

3. **Techy Aesthetic:**  
   - Use a dark background and light text for a code-editor feel.  
   - Stick to a monospaced or clean sans-serif font for readability.  
   - Keep hover effects subtle (e.g., link color changes slightly on hover).  
   - Add no images, only text and links.

## Content Guidelines
1. **Project Listings Only:**  
   - Include finished projects like Flightvisualizer.com and taskflow-done.com.  
   - For ongoing work, list the project with a simple “in progress” note.  
   - Avoid personal details, photos, or any commentary beyond the technical information.

2. **Consistent Styling:**  
   - All projects should be formatted in the same style.  
   - Use a single accent color (e.g., green or cyan) for links or headings.  
   - Make sure all links are direct and functional.

## Deployment and Maintenance
1. **Efficient Processes:**  
   - Keep the build process simple and fast.  
   - Cache dependencies to reduce resource usage.  
   - Use plain HTML, CSS, and JS (or a minimal framework) to maintain a lightweight footprint.

2. **Maintenance Guidelines:**  
   - Clearly document changes to the project list in a `CHANGELOG.md` file.  
   - Ensure all links remain up to date and functional.  
   - Regularly review for dead links or outdated project descriptions.
