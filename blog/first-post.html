                <p>It's essential to understand priorities and the role they play in your life.</p>
                <p>You're the byproduct of what you prioritise.</p>
                <p>To get to the next level, to break free from a job you hate, to change your body, to make more money‚Ä¶ you must learn to prioritise more effectively.</p>
                <p>If you do not prioritise what is required to get you to where you want to be, you will remain where you don't want to be.</p>
                <p>Observe your daily habits.</p>
                <p>How much time is wasted on the phone?<br>
                How much time is wasted on texts and calls?<br>
                How much time is wasted consuming pointless stuff?<br>
                How much time is spent doing something that has no true purpose, beneficial gain or contributing to growth?</p>
                <p>Life is a ticking time üí£<br>
                Every second is counting down the clock towards the end of the life.</p>
                <p>Urgency is a must, you do not have forever.</p>
                <p>Breaks are a must, rest is also crucial, don't get it twisted.</p>
                <p>But‚Ä¶ If you're not happy with where you want to be, you need to start prioritising what makes you uncomfortable‚Ä¶ the things you internally dread doing. It gets easier once you start.</p>
                <p>Sacrifices are required.</p>
                <p>Most opt for comfort and mindless consumption, then wonder why no progression is made.</p>
